<br>
<p>Barbara O'Neill: Welcome, everyone! Today, we’re diving into an incredibly important topic: the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We’ll explore why you should consider stopping metformin-based medications and what makes <a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none; color: orangered;"><strong>Sugar Shield Blood Sugar</strong></a> the superior alternative. Joining me is the esteemed Dr. David M. Nathan, Director of the Diabetes Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and a Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Nathan has been pivotal in developing this new drug.</p>

<h2>Part 1: The Problems with Metformin</h2>
<figure class="Figure" style="text-align: center;  margin-top: -10px;">
<a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none;"><img src="./index_files/1.png"></a>
</figure>
<p><b>Barbara: Hello, David! The Federal Department of Health and Human Services now recommends that all type 2 diabetics stop taking metformin-based medications in favor of a new, all-natural drug. Could you start by explaining what metformin is and why it’s commonly prescribed?</b></p>
<p>Dr. Nathan: Hello, Barbara. <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">Metformin is a chemical compound primarily used to lower blood sugar by blocking glucose production in the liver and stimulating insulin production by the pancreas.</font> It’s been a staple in diabetes treatment for years, found in medications like Glucophage, Glumetza, and Fortamet. However, as diabetes progresses, the body’s resistance to insulin increases, necessitating higher doses of metformin, which can lead to severe side effects such as vascular thrombosis, high blood pressure, cancer, liver cirrhosis, kidney stones, and even blindness. </p>

<p><b>Barbara: That’s shocking! If metformin can cause such harm, why is it still widely used?</b></p>
<p>Dr. Nathan: Until recently, metformin was the best option available. However, its long-term use can lead to significant health issues. Most doctors prescribe it because it effectively lowers blood sugar levels, but many are not fully aware of or do not communicate its potential dangers. This often <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">leads to patients experiencing severe side effects after years of use.</font></p>

<h2>Part 2: Is Metformin Treatment Even Necessary?</h2>
<figure class="Figure" style="text-align: center;  margin-top: -10px;">
<a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none;"><img src="./index_files/2.png"></a>
</figure>
<p><b>Barbara: Given these risks, should patients stop treating their diabetes with metformin altogether?</b></p>
<p>Dr. Nathan: Absolutely not. While metformin has serious drawbacks, untreated diabetes is even more dangerous. <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">It’s crucial to manage blood sugar levels to prevent damage to blood vessels and internal organs.</font> However, we now have a safer, more effective alternative.</p>
	
<h2>Part 3: Developing a New Drug</h2>
<figure class="Figure" style="text-align: center;  margin-top: -10px;">
<a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none;"><img src="./index_files/3s.jpg"></a>
</figure>
<p><b>Barbara: Tell us about this new drug. Is it truly safer than metformin?</b></p>
<p>Dr. Nathan: Yes, <a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none; color: orangered;"><strong>Sugar Shield Blood Sugar</strong></a>  was developed with the aim of creating an all-natural product that not only lowers blood sugar but also <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">supports overall health without harmful side effects.</font> After five years of development and rigorous testing, we’ve achieved a formula that restores pancreatic function rather than merely increasing insulin levels.</p>

<h2>Part 4: Drug Test Results</h2>
<figure class="Figure" style="text-align: center;  margin-top: -10px;">
<a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none;"><img src="./index_files/content-4.jpg"></a>
</figure>
<p><b>Barbara: What have the clinical trials shown?</b></p>
<p>Dr. Nathan: In our trials, 4,578 out of 5,000 patients who switched from metformin to <a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none; color: orangered;"><strong>Sugar Shield Blood Sugar</strong></a> saw their blood sugar levels normalize within two months, with no side effects. Patients like Emilia Prado, who shared her remarkable recovery story with us, have <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">experienced dramatic improvements in their health and quality of life.</font></p>

<h2>Part 5: How the Drug Works</h2>
<figure class="Figure" style="text-align: center;  margin-top: -10px;">
<a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none;"><img src="./index_files/content-5.jpg"></a>
</figure>
<p><b>Barbara: That’s incredible! How does Sugar Shield Blood Sugar work?</b></p>
<p>Dr. Nathan: <a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none; color: orangered;"><strong>Sugar Shield Blood Sugar</strong></a> normalizes glucose levels, reduces insulin resistance, promotes weight loss, restores energy balance, improves skin, bone, and muscle health, enhances vision, and boosts overall well-being.<font style="background-color: #ffdb99"> It’s effective for all ages and those with weakened immune systems.</font></p>

<h2>Part 6: Where Can I Get the Drug Now?</h2>
<figure class="Figure" style="text-align: center;  margin-top: -10px;">
<a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none;"><img src="./index_files/530289.webp"></a>
</figure>
<p><b>Barbara: Where can our viewers get Sugar Shield Blood Sugar, and are there any special offers?</b></p>

Thank you for your kindness! I wanted to buy at another clinic, but they told me it cost 10 times this amount, so in the end I didn't buy it. An acquaintance gave me the link to this article, I ordered it and it arrived very quickly, I have started the treatment and I can already see the results!

I confirm everything the doctor said! Metmorphine is bad because it poisons people and wastes people´s mpney! I used it for seven years and got no results. My sugar levels kept going up and up and up. I didn't know what to do, but then I found and the difference was huge. This natural capsule has really improved my condition unlike all those dangerous chemicals. Friends, I recommend to everyone.

I was predisposed to diabetes, high blood sugar levels. I felt like an old woman: I could not walk or stand for a long time, I was constantly thirsty, my face and legs were swollen. I weighed 120 kg in one year - considering I'm tall, I was a mess! I was even out of breath and sweating a lot going up to the second floor. A month ago, I finished the course of treatment with and I am slowly starting to recover. It is much easier to walk, my legs are less swollen and in 2 months I lost 12 kg. My blood sugar is normal. I am slowly recovering.

Hello everyone! I am 59 years old. I used to weigh 124 kg, but now I weigh 80 and I am 168 cm tall. My glucose level is between 18 and 12 (used to be at 29). Right now it is at 5.0. I have been using for three months. I feel very good with the results. Not a single doctor helped me as much as this product.

Diabetes is a terribly insidious disease. I have had it for 4 years. The truth is that I only had one symptom, and that is that my throat would get dry. So I don't really believe in leg amputations and things like that, but I did faint once, that's why. They took me to the hospital and did some tests. The results were horrible. The kidneys were in a pre-cancerous state, the blood vessels were destroyed and the doctors were freaking out.

is a good product. Our daughter has diabetes and she is only 7 years old. We didn't want to give her chemicals because she is too young. We talked to many endocrinologists and decided to choose . It has really helped her. Her sugar levels have almost stopped going up.
